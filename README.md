## ðŸš€ Deployment & Operations

### Domain Model

- **staging.mikeiu.com**: Automatically deploys latest `main` branch
- **mikeiu.com**: Manual promotion from staging required

### Main Pipeline

Push to `main` triggers:

1. Quality checks (typecheck, lint, build)
2. Deploy to staging with database migrations
3. Run smoke tests against staging
4. Manual approval gate for production
5. Promote same build to production

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Local development
pnpm dev                    # Start development server
pnpm build                  # Build all packages
pnpm typecheck              # Run TypeScript checks
pnpm lint                   # Run ESLint

# Database operations
pnpm db:start              # Start local Supabase
pnpm db:stop               # Stop local Supabase
pnpm db:reset              # Reset local database

# Testing (placeholders)
pnpm e2e:smoke             # Run smoke tests locally
pnpm e2e:smoke:ci          # Run smoke tests in CI

# Health checks
./scripts/health-check.sh   # Quick health check (both domains)
```

### Manual Operations

- **Trigger deployment**: Push to `main` or use GitHub Actions UI
- **Approve production**: Review and approve in GitHub Actions workflow
- **Emergency rollback**: See [docs/operations/deployment-rollback.md](docs/operations/deployment-rollback.md)
