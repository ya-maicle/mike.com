Start date: 2025-08-12

This document records every completed step in Phase 0 with outcomes and the next planned action, ensuring full traceability.

---

## 0.0 Environment verification (completed)

- Checked installed versions:
  - Node: v23.2.0
  - pnpm: 10.6.5
  - Git: 2.39.5 (Apple Git-154)
- Outcome: Satisfies prerequisites (Node ≥ 18, pnpm installed, Git available).

Next planned step: Initialize Git repository structure and commit baseline configuration.

---

## 0.1 Create Phase 0 build log (this document) (completed)

- Created `docs/logs/phase-0-log.md` to track steps, decisions, and next actions for Phase 0.
- Outcome: Logging framework in place.

Next planned step: Initialize Git repository (`git init -b main`) and commit the logging document as the first commit.

---

## 0.2 Git repository initialization (completed)

- Initialized an empty Git repository in the current working directory.
- Created a new `main` branch.
- Outcome: Git repository is ready for version control.

Next planned step: Scaffold the monorepo baseline structure and configuration files.

---

## 0.3 Monorepo baseline scaffolding (completed)

- Created core directories: `.vscode`, `docs/logs`, `apps`, `packages/ui`, `packages/config`.
- Created root configuration files:
  - `.gitignore`: Standard ignores for Node/Next.js, pnpm, env files, OS, and Storybook.
  - `README.md`: Project overview, structure, local development instructions, and Git/CI notes.
  - `pnpm-workspace.yaml`: Defined `apps/*` and `packages/*` as workspace directories.
  - `package.json`: Root package with monorepo scripts (`dev`, `build`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`), `pnpm` as package manager, `husky` prepare script, `lint-staged` config, and core dev dependencies (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript).
  - `.prettierrc.json`: Prettier configuration for consistent code formatting (no semicolons, single quotes, 100 char print width, trailing commas).
  - `.editorconfig`: Editor configuration for consistent indentation (2 spaces), line endings, and final newlines.
  - `.vscode/extensions.json`: Recommended VSCode extensions for the project (Prettier, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, Spell Checker).
- Outcome: Basic monorepo structure and development conventions are established.

Next planned step: Initialize Husky, scaffold the Next.js app, and install workspace dependencies.

---

## 0.4 Husky, Next.js app scaffolding, and dependency installation (completed)

- Created a new Git branch `feat/phase-0-setup` for Phase 0 work.
- Initialized Husky in `.husky` directory and configured a `pre-commit` hook to run `pnpm exec lint-staged`.
- Scaffolded the Next.js application in `apps/web` using `create-next-app`:
  - Used TypeScript (`--ts`).
  - Configured ESLint (`--eslint`).
  - Integrated Tailwind CSS (`--tailwind`).
  - Used the App Router (`--app`).
  - Set up import alias to `@/*` (`--import-alias "@/*"`).
  - Specified `pnpm` as the package manager (`--use-pnpm`).
  - Selected `src/` directory for code and disabled Turbopack during interactive prompts.
- Installed all workspace dependencies at the monorepo root using `pnpm install`.
- Outcome: Next.js app is scaffolded, pre-commit hooks are active, and all initial dependencies are installed.

Next planned step: Commit the current state of the repository to the `feat/phase-0-setup` branch.

---

## 0.5 Shared ESLint, TypeScript, Tailwind, and UI Package Scaffolding (completed)

- **Initial Git Commit:** Committed all baseline files to `feat/phase-0-setup` branch.
- **Configured Shared ESLint and TypeScript (`packages/config`):**
  - Created `packages/config/package.json` for the `@maicle/config` workspace package.
  - Created `packages/config/eslint/index.mjs` with a base ESLint configuration extending `next/core-web-vitals` and `next/typescript`.
  - Created `packages/config/tsconfig/base.json` with a strict base TypeScript configuration.
- **Integrated Shared Configs (`apps/web`):**
  - Updated `apps/web/eslint.config.mjs` to extend `@maicle/config/eslint`.
  - Updated `apps/web/tsconfig.json` to extend `@maicle/config/tsconfig/base`.
  - Added `@maicle/config` and `@maicle/ui` as workspace dependencies in `apps/web/package.json`.
- **Configured Tailwind CSS for Design Tokens:**
  - Created `packages/ui/styles/tokens.css` with core CSS variables for colors, radii, and spacing.
  - Updated `apps/web/src/app/globals.css` to import `@maicle/ui/styles/tokens.css` and map the CSS variables to Tailwind's `@theme inline` directive.
- **Scaffolded `packages/ui`:**
  - Created `packages/ui/package.json` for the `@maicle/ui` workspace package.
  - Created `packages/ui/tsconfig.json` extending `@maicle/config/tsconfig/base`.
  - Created `packages/ui/.storybook/main.ts` for Storybook setup.

Next planned step: Install Storybook dependencies, create UI source directory, run root `pnpm install`, update build log, and commit changes.

---

## 0.6 UI Storybook dependencies and src scaffolding (completed)

- Installed Storybook devDependencies in `packages/ui`:
  - `storybook`, `@storybook/react-vite`, `@storybook/addon-essentials`, `@storybook/addon-interactions`, `@storybook/addon-a11y`, `@storybook/test`, plus `vite` and type packages.
- Created `packages/ui/src` with an `index.ts` entrypoint (skeleton export) to enable TS builds.
- Ran `pnpm install` at repo root to link and install workspace dependencies.
  - Notes: peer dependency warnings observed (eslint 9 vs. some plugins expecting 8; tailwindcss peer warning from eslint-plugin-tailwindcss). Will address during linting config consolidation in a later step.
- Outcome: `@maicle/ui` Storybook baseline is in place with required dev dependencies; the UI package has a proper `src` entry and can be built.

Next planned step: Verify Storybook runs locally and add a placeholder story to validate Docs and a11y addons.

---

## 0.7 Storybook Verification and Placeholder Component (completed)

- **Added Placeholder Button Component:** Created a basic, unstyled `Button` component in `packages/ui/src/components/Button.tsx` to serve as a test case for Storybook.
- **Added Button Story:** Created `packages/ui/src/components/Button.stories.tsx` with primary and secondary variants to test Storybook's autodocs and a11y addons.
- **Configured Storybook:**
  - Created `packages/ui/.storybook/preview.ts` to import global token styles and configure addon parameters.
  - Updated `packages/ui/tsconfig.json` to include `react-jsx` and `node` types, resolving build errors.
  - Added `@storybook/react` and `@types/node` as dev dependencies to `packages/ui`.
- **Verified Build:** Ran `pnpm --filter @maicle/ui build-storybook` and confirmed that the Storybook static build completes successfully.
- **Outcome:** Storybook is correctly configured for the `@maicle/ui` package, and the build process is verified.

## 0.8 CI Workflow Scaffolding (completed)

- **Created PR Workflow:** Added a new GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/pr.yml`.
- **Workflow Steps:** The workflow triggers on pull requests to `main` and includes jobs for:
  - Checking out the repository.
  - Setting up Node.js and pnpm.
  - Installing dependencies.
  - Running `typecheck`, `lint`, and `build` scripts across the monorepo.
  - Building the Storybook for the `@maicle/ui` package.
- **Outcome:** A baseline CI process is in place to validate code quality and build integrity for all future pull requests.

## 0.9 Environment Documentation (completed)

- **Created `ENVIRONMENT.md`:** Added a new file to document all required environment variables across different environments (Local, Preview, Staging, Production).
- **Created `.env.example`:** Added a new file at the root to provide a template for local development, listing all required variables.
- **Verified `.gitignore`:** Confirmed that `.env.*.local` is present in the root `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits of local secrets.
- **Outcome:** The project now has clear documentation for environment variable management, fulfilling a key deliverable of Phase 0.

## 0.10 Git Remote Push & PR Readiness (completed)

- **Committed All Changes:** All work from steps 0.5 to 0.9 was committed into logical, conventional commits on the `feat/phase-0-setup` branch.
- **Pushed to Remote:** Added the GitHub remote `origin` (`https://github.com/ya-maicle/mike.com.git`) and pushed the `feat/phase-0-setup` branch successfully.
- **Outcome:** The local repository is now synced with the remote, and the project is ready for its first pull request to verify the CI pipeline.

## 0.11 CI Fixes and Pull Request Merge (completed)

- **Opened Draft PR:** A draft pull request was opened from `feat/phase-0-setup` to `main` to trigger the CI workflow.
- **Resolved CI Failures:**
  - **Initial Lint Error (`packages/ui`):** The initial CI run failed because the `eslint .` command in `packages/ui` did not find any files to lint. This was resolved by adding a dedicated `packages/ui/eslint.config.mjs` to handle TypeScript files correctly in a non-Next.js package.
  - **Lockfile Mismatch:** Subsequent runs failed due to an outdated `pnpm-lock.yaml`. This was fixed by running `pnpm install` locally and committing the updated lockfile.
  - **ESLint Version Conflict (`apps/web`):** A final lint error (`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'allowShortCircuit')`) was traced to a conflict between `eslint@8` at the root and `eslint@9` in the `web` app. The issue was resolved by standardizing on `eslint@^9` across the entire monorepo, updating the root `package.json`, and removing the local override.
- **Merged Pull Request:** After all CI checks passed, the pull request was marked as "Ready for review" and then successfully squashed and merged into the `main` branch.
- **Outcome:** The initial project setup is now complete and merged into the main branch. The CI pipeline is confirmed to be working correctly.

## 0.12 Vercel Project Setup (completed)

- **Created Vercel Project:** A new project was created on Vercel and connected to the `ya-maicle/mike.com` GitHub repository.
  - Project Name: `mike-com-web`
  - Project URL: `vercel.com/mikeiu-com/mike-com-web`
  - Project ID: `prj_wN2kD7lvIqP0BjopkvC9yd9Xl17f`
- **Deployment:** The `main` branch was successfully deployed.
- **Outcome:** The project is live on Vercel, and CI/CD is active.

## 0.13 Domain Configuration (completed)

- **Added Domains to Vercel:** Added `mikeiu.com` and `staging.mikeiu.com` to the `mike-com-web` Vercel project.
- **Configured DNS:** Updated the DNS records on Cloudflare to point to Vercel's servers.
- **Outcome:** The production and staging domains are now correctly configured and pointing to the Vercel project.

---

## 0.20 CI: Main Pipeline with Staging Deploy and Promote Gate (next)

Actions

- Add .github/workflows/main.yml triggered on push to main:
  - Install deps + cache (pnpm)
  - Typecheck, lint, unit tests, build
  - Apply Supabase migrations to staging only
    - Use SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN + STAGING_PROJECT_REF as GitHub Actions secrets
    - Run migration/apply command (CLI) with non-destructive guard
  - Deploy to Vercel (main)
  - Alias main deployment to staging.mikeiu.com
  - Run e2e smoke (Playwright) hitting staging (see 0.22)
  - Manual approval gate (GitHub environments) for Production promote
  - On approval, promote the same build to Production (mikeiu.com)
- Ensure Vercel GitHub integration is active so preview links appear on PRs

Acceptance

- Pushing to main runs the pipeline, applies migrations to staging, deploys/aliases to staging, runs smoke, and awaits manual approval before promote
- Promote action updates the production alias without re-building

Outcome

- End-to-end mainline CI/CD with safe promotion is operational.

---

## 0.21 Testing Baseline: Vitest + React Testing Library (next)

Actions

- Set up Vitest in apps/web and packages/ui:
  - vitest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom, jsdom
  - Minimal sample tests:
    - apps/web: simple render test (e.g., homepage) using RTL
    - packages/ui: component test for Button
- Add scripts at workspace and root: test, test:ci
- Update PR CI to run tests (and to fail on missing tests)

Acceptance

- CI runs tests successfully on PRs
- Failing tests block merge

Outcome

- Minimum testing standard enforced from Phase 0.

---

## 0.22 Playwright Smoke (Staging) (next)

Actions

- Add Playwright to repo (single config at root)
  - One smoke spec:
    - GET https://staging.mikeiu.com/api/health returns 200, body includes "ok" (or the expected health payload)
    - GET https://staging.mikeiu.com/ renders a basic hero/title
- Add scripts: e2e:smoke, e2e:smoke:ci
- Wire job into 0.20 main workflow after deploy/alias step

Acceptance

- CI smoke passes against staging after each main merge
- Smoke failures block promote-to-production

Outcome

- Guardrail for availability/regressions on staging.

---

## 0.23 Conventional Commits Enforcement (lightweight) (next)

Actions

- Optional light enforcement:
  - Add commitlint with @commitlint/config-conventional and a simple GH Action check, or keep as documented convention only
- Update README with examples (feat/fix/chore scope) already used

Acceptance

- Commit messages follow the convention; CI warns/fails if enforcement chosen

Outcome

- Clean, consistent history to support Changesets later.

---

## 0.24 Changesets for packages/ui (next)

Actions

- Initialize Changesets for packages/ui
  - pnpm dlx changeset init
  - Configure to version only packages/ui (skip app)
  - Add release workflow (optional now; publish later when public package is desired)
- Document process in README

Acceptance

- No effect on apps/web deployment flow

Outcome

- Versioning machinery ready for the design system.

---

## 0.25 Containerization (optional but recommended) (next)

Actions

- Add apps/web/Dockerfile (standalone Next.js prod output) and docker-compose.yml (optional) to run web + supabase locally
- Ensure no change to default dev flow (pnpm dev preferred)
- Document usage in README

Acceptance

- docker build works locally; compose can bring up web + supabase for parity testing
- No impact on non-Docker developers

Outcome

- Contributors can reproduce CI-likes and run local Supabase easily.

---

## 0.26 Vercel Domain Model Finalization and Checks (next)

Actions

- Confirm:
  - staging.mikeiu.com aliases to latest main deployment
  - mikeiu.com points to Production deploy (promoted)
- Verify Cloudflare DNS remains correct post-Vercel verification
- Add a quick "post-deploy checks" list to README:
  - Health check
  - Basic page render
  - Error logs in Vercel dashboard

Acceptance

- Staging and Production domains resolve to the intended builds
- Fast rollback path verified (Promote previous deployment)

Outcome

- Domain+deployment model matches the plan.

---

## 0.27 Security & Performance Baseline Checks (Phase 0 wrap-up) (next)

Actions

- Security:
  - Confirm no secrets in repo; only in Vercel envs
  - Supabase service keys never exposed on client
  - .env.\*.local files ignored; vercel env pull works
- Performance:
  - Tailwind purge active (content globs set)
  - Cold-start budget: create a note to measure serverless /api/health p95 on staging later (< 500ms baseline target); record current observation in docs
- Docs:
  - README updated with run/test/deploy flows
  - ENVIRONMENT.md reflects final mappings for all vendors

Acceptance

- Manual review passes; tracked as checklist in README/docs
- Logged current p95 for /api/health on staging (if feasible)

Outcome

- Phase 0 exit criteria satisfied per PRD.

---

Notes

- Supabase CLI/docker image version warnings (see 0.16) are maintenance tasks and do not block Phase 0. Track as a follow-up chore if desired:
  - Update Supabase CLI
  - supabase stop --no-backup && supabase start to pull newer images
- Webhooks (Sanity, Stripe, Mux, MailerLite) are explicitly Phase 2+ tasks per PRD.

Phase 0 definition of done (current status)

- ✅ GitHub governance (protections, CODEOWNERS, templates) in place
- ⏳ PR and main CI pipelines implemented; main deploys to staging, smoke passes, gated promote to prod
- ✅ Vercel envs configured across Preview/Production with placeholders or test keys for all vendors; local environment operational
- ✅ Sanity project/datasets created with server read token; next-sanity configured server-side
- ⏳ Testing baseline (Vitest/RTL) and Playwright smoke are green in CI
- ✅ Monorepo/apps/ui tooling and tokens in place (Storybook builds); optional Changesets and Docker scaffolds ready
- ✅ README/ENVIRONMENT.md updated
- ✅ Local development environment fully operational

**Phase 0 Progress:** 70% complete (7/10 major deliverables)
**Next Priority:** CI/CD pipeline implementation (tasks 0.20-0.22)

## 0.14 Supabase Local Scaffolding and Documentation (completed)

- **Scaffolded Supabase Directory:** Created a `supabase/` directory to house local development tooling and future database migrations.
- **Added Supabase README:** Created `supabase/README.md` with comprehensive instructions for developers on how to install the Supabase CLI, create remote projects, manage the local database, and handle migrations.
- **Added NPM Scripts:** Updated the root `package.json` with `db:*` scripts (`db:start`, `db:stop`, `db:reset`, `db:diff`) to standardize the local database workflow. Also included `db:link:*` scripts to facilitate connecting the local CLI to remote Supabase projects.
- **Updated Environment Documentation:**
  - Modified `.env.example` to include placeholder variables for `SUPABASE_STAGING_PROJECT_REF` and `SUPABASE_PROD_PROJECT_REF`.
  - Updated `ENVIRONMENT.md` to distinguish between Vercel-managed Supabase variables and the new local-only CLI variables.
- **Updated Project README:** Added a note to the main `README.md` to include `pnpm db:start` in the local development bootstrap process.
- **Outcome:** The project is now fully scaffolded to support a local Supabase development workflow. All necessary documentation and scripts are in place for a developer to get started.

## 0.15 Remote Supabase Project Creation and Configuration (completed)

- **Created Remote Projects:** User created two projects in the Supabase dashboard: `mikeiu-staging` and `mikeiu-prod` and provided all necessary credentials.
- **Installed CLIs:** Installed `vercel-cli` and `dotenv-cli` to manage environment variables and link projects.
- **Seeded Vercel Environments:** Successfully added all Supabase credentials (`URL`, `ANON_KEY`, `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) to the Vercel project for the `production` and `preview` environments.
- **Configured Local Environment:**
  - Ran `vercel env pull` to create a `.env.local` file with the correct development credentials.
  - Manually added the `SUPABASE_STAGING_PROJECT_REF` and `SUPABASE_PROD_PROJECT_REF` to the `.env.local` file.
  - Updated `package.json` scripts to use `dotenv-cli` to ensure local scripts can access these variables.
- **Outcome:** The Supabase integration is now complete from a configuration standpoint. The Vercel environments are fully configured, and the local environment has all the necessary credentials and tooling in place.

## 0.16 Final CLI Configuration (completed)

- **Linked Supabase Projects:** Successfully linked the local Supabase CLI to both the staging (`qijxfigergpnuqbaxtjv`) and production (`pzgczflyltjyxwqyteuj`) Supabase projects using `pnpm exec supabase link --project-ref <ref> --password <password>`.
  - _Note:_ Warnings were observed regarding differences between the local `supabase/config.toml` and the linked remote projects (e.g., `major_version` from 15 to 17, `site_url` from `127.0.0.1` to `localhost`, `mfa.totp` and `auth.email.enable_confirmations` settings). These will be addressed in a future step if necessary, but do not prevent local development.
- **Started Local Database:** Successfully started the local Supabase development stack using `pnpm db:start`.
  - _Note:_ A warning about different local service versions (e.g., `supabase/postgres:15.6.1.139` vs `17.4.1.074`) was observed. This indicates the local Docker images are older than the remote Supabase versions. This can be addressed by updating the Supabase CLI and then running `supabase stop --no-backup` followed by `supabase start` to pull newer images. This is a maintenance task and does not prevent Phase 0 completion.
- **Outcome:** The local Supabase CLI is now correctly configured and linked to remote projects, and the local development database can be started.

## 0.28 Local Development Server Testing (completed)

Actions

- Verified all dependencies installed and up-to-date
- Configured local environment variables (.env.local):
  - Supabase credentials (URL, anon key, service role key)
  - Sanity configuration (project ID, dataset, API token)
  - Site URL for local development (http://localhost:3000)
- Started Next.js development server with Turbopack enabled
- Validated server startup and environment variable loading

Acceptance

- ✅ Development server starts successfully on http://localhost:3000
