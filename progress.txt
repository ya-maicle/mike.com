## Audit Report (CLEANUP-001)

### Redundant Files/Dirs
- `dist/`: Root-level directory containing build artifacts (favicon.ico, index.html, static/). **Risk: Safe** (Generated).
- `default-profile-pics/`: Root-level directory. Empty. **Risk: Safe**.
- `playwright-report/`: Root-level directory. Generated by Playwright. **Risk: Safe** (Should be gitignored).
- `test-results/`: Root-level directory. Generated by Playwright. **Risk: Safe** (Should be gitignored).

### Generated Artifacts (should be gitignored)
- `dist/`: Standard build output.
- `playwright-report/`: Test reports.
- `test-results/`: Test results.
- Note: `.next/` and `packages/ui/dist/` are already handled by gitignore but are present.

### Potentially Unused Code
- **Dependency Redundancy**: `lucide-react` is present in both root `package.json` and `apps/web/package.json`. If only used in web, remove from root.
- **Framework Redundancy**: `react` and `react-dom` are in both root and `apps/web`. Monorepo usually hoists these, but strict pnpm workspaces might require them in apps. Root ones might be redundant if no root-level code uses them (e.g. scripts).
- **Sanity Components**: `sanity-plugin-media` and `sanity-plugin-mux-input` are in root. If Sanity Studio is embedded in `apps/web`, these might belong there.

### Candidate Dependencies for Removal
- `styled-components` (Root): Not imported in `apps/web/src` or `packages/ui/src`. It is a dependency of `@sanity/ui` and `sanity`, so it might be a required peer dependency, but explicit root dependency might be removable if pnpm handles it. **Risk: Moderate**.
- `lucide-react` (Root): Likely unused in root (scripts don't typically use UI icons). **Risk: Safe**.
- `@sanity/vision` (Root): If only used in Studio (in `apps/web`), should move to `apps/web` or devDeps. **Risk: Low**.
