# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
<!-- Consolidated reusable patterns discovered during iterations -->

## 2026-02-11 - TEST-002
- Created RALPH_AUTOMATION_TEST.md
- Verified `./ralph-loop` script auto-detects environment and runs `npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- Note: Script halted at authentication step (requires `claude login`)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Automation script logic is sound
  - Users must authenticate Claude Code before running the loop autonomously

## 2026-02-11 - VISUAL-001
- Added "Ralph Visual Verification" banner to homepage
- Verified visibility using browser subagent
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Browser checking works perfectly for visual validation
  - Dev server needs a few seconds to HMR before screenshotting

## 2026-02-12 - PR-001
- Implemented user story to remove test artifacts from the branch.
- Performed a soft reset to `origin/main` (7c72abb).
- Deleted `RALPH_AUTOMATION_TEST.md` and `RALPH_VERIFIED.md`.
- Reverted changes to `apps/web/src/app/(website)/page.tsx`.
- Ran quality checks (`typecheck`, `lint`, `build`), which all passed.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `git checkout` with paths containing parentheses requires quoting the path.
  - The `apps/web` package is missing a `typecheck` script in its `package.json`, so `pnpm typecheck` does not check it. The build process, however, seems to perform the necessary checks.
