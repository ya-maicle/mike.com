## Project: mikeiu.com - Secure Next.js Web Application

### Current Status

**Branch:** `feat/phase-0-setup`  
**Phase:** Phase 0 (Project Setup & Infrastructure) - Near completion

### Summary of Changes

This PR represents the completion of Phase 0 setup for mikeiu.com, establishing the foundational infrastructure for a secure, scalable Next.js web application with integrated CMS, authentication, payments, and analytics capabilities.

### Key Components Implemented

#### 1. Monorepo Structure

- **Root:** Git repository with trunk-based workflow
- **apps/web:** Next.js application (TypeScript, Tailwind, App Router)
- **packages/ui:** Design system with Storybook
- **packages/config:** Shared ESLint/TypeScript configurations

#### 2. Development Infrastructure

- **Tooling:** TypeScript, ESLint v9, Prettier, EditorConfig
- **Build System:** pnpm workspaces with cross-package dependencies
- **Design System:** Token-based CSS variables, Radix UI primitives, Storybook

#### 3. CI/CD Pipeline

- **GitHub Actions:** PR checks (typecheck, lint, build, Storybook)
- **Quality Gates:** Required status checks before merge
- **Standardization:** ESLint version consistency across monorepo

#### 4. Deployment & Hosting

- **Platform:** Vercel with domain configuration
- **Environments:** Production (mikeiu.com) and Staging (staging.mikeiu.com)
- **Infrastructure:** Edge/serverless deployment model

#### 5. Database & Authentication

- **Provider:** Supabase (staging/production projects)
- **Local Development:** Docker-based local stack
- **Environment Management:** Vercel env integration with secure token handling

#### 6. Governance & Quality

- **Code Ownership:** CODEOWNERS file for review assignments
- **Templates:** PR and issue templates for consistency
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive environment and setup guides

### Files Modified

- `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore patterns
- `ENVIRONMENT.md` - Environment configuration documentation
- `README.md` - Project setup and development instructions
- `docs/logs/phase-0-log.md` - Detailed build log and progress tracking
- `package.json` - Root package configuration
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Dependency lock file

### Files Added

- `.github/CODEOWNERS` - Code ownership assignments
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` - Issue templates for bug reports and features
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` - Standardized PR template
- `apps/web/src/app/api/` - API route foundations
- `apps/web/src/sanity/` - Sanity CMS integration setup
- `claude/` - AI assistant context and documentation
- `docs/product_requirements_document.md` - Comprehensive project requirements
- `supabase/` - Database schema and configuration

### Next Steps (Phase 1)

The immediate next phase will focus on:

- **Task 0.18:** Sanity project/datasets and environment wiring
- **Task 0.19:** Vendor environment placeholders (Stripe, Mux, Resend, MailerLite, PostHog, Sentry)
- **Task 0.20:** Main CI pipeline with staging deploy and promotion gates
- **Phase 1:** Authentication + core database schema with RLS implementation

### Security Considerations

- Environment variables properly segregated by environment
- No secrets committed to repository
- Supabase RLS prepared for deny-by-default security model
- Webhook signature verification patterns established

### Testing Strategy

- Unit testing framework ready (Vitest + React Testing Library)
- Component testing via Storybook
- E2E testing framework prepared (Playwright)
- CI/CD quality gates enforced

### Performance & Accessibility

- Design system tokens for consistent UI
- Tree-shakeable component architecture
- A11y testing integrated in Storybook
- Performance budget guidelines established

### Dependencies & Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Radix UI
- **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres + Auth), Sanity CMS
- **Build:** pnpm, TypeScript, ESLint 9, Prettier
- **Testing:** Vitest, React Testing Library, Storybook, Playwright
- **Infrastructure:** Vercel, GitHub Actions

This PR establishes a solid foundation for the phased development approach outlined in the PRD, with particular attention to security, scalability, and developer experience.
